# Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)

This repository contains Python scripts and notes made while following the Coursera course **"Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)"** by the University of California San Diego.

The code corresponds to different exercises, code challenges, and programming problems from the course. Work is in progress as I complete the course.

Some scripts solve problems like:

* Pattern matching
* GC skew analysis
* Frequent k-mer search (with mismatches and reverse complements)
* Finding origin of replication
* Hamming distance and neighbors

Files are organized according to each week's tasks.

**Note:** This is not a polished project. The repository is used to track my progress through the course.
